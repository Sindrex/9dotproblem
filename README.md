 * DATABASE_PASS: The password for the user.
 * DATABASE_DB: Which database to use within this user and host .
 * URL: The URL which the server is hosted on. Domain name or IP adress. E.g. "https://ninedotproblem.herokuapp.com".
   Note that you might need ":PORT" added to the end of the URL, where PORT is the port the server is listening on.
